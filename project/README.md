#C212 Final Project - Trails
##What is Trails?
Trails is a 2 player game played on a board of hexagonal tiles. It can be seen as having a similar complexity as chess or go, but with simple rules and a clear winning state that allows new players to quickly pick up and play with ease. The game offers intricacies that make the game rewarding to master and, combined with the impossibility of a draw-game, gives a satisfying game.
