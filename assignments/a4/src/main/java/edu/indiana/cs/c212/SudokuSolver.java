 solve a sudoku puzzle. this is the entry class of 3 classes:
 SudokuSolver, SudokuPuzzle, and SudokuCell.

	/**
	 * canSolve is the heart of this assignment.  It requires relatively few
	 * lines of code, but you'll need to understand depth first search, recursion,
	 * and backtracking (as discussed in class), in order to make it work nicely.
	 * 
	 * canSolve takes a SudokuPuzzle as an argument and returns true
	 * if the puzzle can be solved and false otherwise.  An approach
	 * for solving this problem might be as follows:
	 * 
	 *   A possible approach:
	 *      1. check to see if there is an empty cell.
	 *         A. If there isn't an empty cell left in the puzzle, what does that mean? (think base case in recursion)
	 *      2. If there is an empty cell, check to see if you can legally insert a value into that cell.
	 *         A. if you can legally insert a digit into that cell, check to see if you can solve the puzzle.
	 *            -- if it turns out that making that insertion didn't get you any closer to solving the puzzle, undo the move.
	 *            -- if it turns out that insertion did lead, somewhere down the road, to a solved puzzle then you're done.
	 *      3. if you check every possible insertion and none of them lead to a solved puzzle, then the
	 *         puzzle is unsolvable.
	 *      
	 *   Hint: Recursion will very much be your friend for this problem.
	 *    
	 * @param puzzle
	 * @return true if the puzzle can be solved and false otherwise
